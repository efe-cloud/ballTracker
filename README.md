Developed a dodgeball robot in a team of five, integrating sensors and a camera-based system for real-time ball tracking and evasion. The project combined electrical and computer engineering disciplines, with tasks including Arduino programming, circuit assembly, and the implementation of an OpenCV-based vision system for ball trajectory prediction and autonomous movement control. The robot achieved a 90% evasion rate during testing. This system mirrors advanced driver-assistance technologies in modern vehicles, where cameras detect pedestrians or obstacles, and the car autonomously maneuvers to prevent collisions. Our project demonstrated similar real-time object detection and evasive decision-making, showcasing applications in both robotics and automotive safety systems.
